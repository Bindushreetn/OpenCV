# OpenCV

It stands for Open Source Computer Vision Library. This library consists of around 2000+ optimised algorithms that are useful for computer vision and machine learning. There are several ways you can use opencv in image processing, a few are listed below:

- Converting images from one color space to another i.e. like between BGR and HSV, BGR and gray etc.
- Performing thresholding on images, like, simple thresholding, adaptive thresholding etc. 
- Smoothing of images, like, applying custom filters to images and blurring of images.
- Performing morphological operations on images.
- Building image pyramids.
- Extracting foreground from images using GrabCut algorithm.
- Image segmentation using watershed algorithm.
